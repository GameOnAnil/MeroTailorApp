# Mero Tailor App
This is an app made for a Tailor/ Clothing shop where the owner can add all the clothing orders and keep track of all the order and what clothes are paid/ unpaid.We also have a notification system to keep track of all the urgent orders that are due soon.
<p> All the data are stored in local Sqlite Db so the user doesn't have to login to any account.
